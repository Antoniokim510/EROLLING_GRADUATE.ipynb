# **Student Enrollment Prediction**

## **Overview**
This project uses machine learning to predict:
1. Whether a student is likely to enroll in a program.
2. Which students may need additional support to graduate successfully.

By analyzing historical data, academic performance, and demographics, the model provides actionable insights to help educational institutions improve student outcomes.

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Input**:
   - **Historical Data**: Previous enrollment patterns and outcomes.
   - **Academic Records**: GPA, attendance, and grades.
   - **Demographics**: Socioeconomic background and other relevant factors.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost) is trained to identify patterns in the data.
   - The model predicts enrollment likelihood and highlights key risk factors.

3. **Insights**:
   - Identifies students at risk of dropping out or struggling to graduate.
   - Provides recommendations for targeted support strategies.
